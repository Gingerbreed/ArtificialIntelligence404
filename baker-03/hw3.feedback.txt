Morgan,

Here is the breakdown of your grade and feedback by parts:

a) Pocket Algorithm starting at w=0

- It seems like the error could be several different things. The code in your
  repository gives me no error but does not produce any results either. You
  must work a bit harder trying to understand and debug your code. -10pts

b) Linear Regression as classification

- You reported no E_out -5pts

b) Pocket Algorithm starting with Linear Regression

- Same as a)

- Good intuition though


+5pts for using LaTeX


Peace,
- Dr. Rivas
